# Hi, I'm Maxence 👋🏻🇫🇷

I'm a French computer science student passionate about development and innovation. I enjoy working with PHP, particularly Symfony, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies. I love building software solutions and sharing my knowledge with others. I often stream programming sessions where I work on various projects and discuss coding techniques.
